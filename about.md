I'm penetration tester [@prismacsi](https://www.prismacsi.com/). I have been interested in all kinds of informatics for a long time. I realized that my interest in cyber security is quite high. 

## Hack All Day
["Hack All Day"](http://www.hackallday.com/) is an independent organization that we have established with a friend. Its aim is to confuse individuals who want to progress in the cyber security. We try organize events, write blog posts and draw sweepstakes.
