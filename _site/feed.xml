Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But what then, señor?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Millions señor? Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot walk alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free at last! Free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>martin</name></author><category term="speeches" /><summary type="html">I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Purpose of Education</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll-theme-dark-reader/posts/1948/12/12/the-purpose-of-education/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Purpose of Education" /><published>1948-12-12T13:18:00+03:00</published><updated>1948-12-12T13:18:00+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll-theme-dark-reader/posts/1948/12/12/the-purpose-of-education</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll-theme-dark-reader/posts/1948/12/12/the-purpose-of-education/">&lt;p&gt;As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>martin</name></author><category term="speeches" /><category term="fiction" /><summary type="html">As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education.
